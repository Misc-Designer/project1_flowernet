UDACITY Final Project - Jason Marxsen

Preprocess.py and build_model.py are helper functions for the main files, predict.py and train.py.

Both main files contain help features; simply run the files from the command line with the argument "-h" to bring up the help documentation.

Some sample pre-trained checkpoints are present in the chkpts folder, if desired. As of this moment, the densenet pre-trained model is the most accurate.
